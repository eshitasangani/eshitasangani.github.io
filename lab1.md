# Lab 1: Artemis

The purpose of this lab was to become more accustomed with the Artemis board that will be used throughout the rest of the class. We explored the onboard funcions such as the microphone, LED, and temperature sensor as well as the serial communication by connecting the board to our computer. Since an Arduino IDE was used with this board, some of the examples that are available with the IDE were incorporated. 


## Blink

This Arduino example blinks the LED on and off - as seen in the video below.
