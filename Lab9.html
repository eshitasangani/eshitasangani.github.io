                The purpose of this lab is to use the TOF + IMU sensors on my robot 
                to map out a room. This is done by taking various distance measurements 
                from different locations around the room. At each location specified 
                by the lab instructions, I used PID control to spin in a slow circle 
                and sample data accordingly. After calculating that, I used transformation 
                matrices to combine all these measurements and eventually build an accurate 
                map of the room. 
                </p>

                    <p>
                        I chose to implement my control system using a PID angular 
                        speed control. This uses the raw gyroscope data that I recorded 
                        while spinning the robot at a constant angular velocity around 
                        the z axis. I definitely wanted to use closed loop control because 
                        it results in more accurate data and because of the increased 
                        control it provides me instead of having to deal with 
                        the environment factors. In implementing this, I tried to spin my 
                        robot every 20ish degrees and record data accordingly. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        I first wanted to recalculate the best PID gain. I started out 
                        using the 0.05 as my Kp value because I wanted to have my robot rotate 
                        at a constant speed. The performance was kinda all over the place at first 
                        because of the battery power. I didn;t want to add an integral term because 
                        of the windup that it would give and the fluctuation that would happen 
                        as a result. I tried adding D but it wasn't consistent enough to justify 
                        incorporating it. 
                    </p>

                        I first wanted to recalculate the best PID gain. I started out 
                        using the 0.05 as my Kp value because I wanted to have my robot rotate 
                        at a constant speed. The performance was kinda all over the place at first 
                        because of the battery power. I didn't want to add an integral term because 
                        of the windup that it would give and the fluctuation that would happen 
                        as a result. I tried adding D but it wasn't consistent enough to justify 
                        incorporating it. From plotting the angular velocity, it's a little noisy, but 
                        you can see that it rotates around 20 degrees on average. Because it was pretty noisy, 
                        I added a lowpass filter later on to improve the accuracy of my readings. 
                        I used open loop control to figure out the min speed that I was able to 
                        spin the robot at, which was around 90. For every spin, I obtained around 
                        150 data points, around 15 data points every second. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        This is my code that I used for the PID control and the case. I sent 
                        all the data after it was done to make sure that the sending did 
                        not change the execution time of my program. Finding the values was 
                        difficult because every run was different because of the floor, the battery level, 
                        and the exact position I placed the robot at.

                       then placed it across the 4 different distances across the lab.
