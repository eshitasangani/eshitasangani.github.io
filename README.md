Hi! My name is Eshita Sangani and this is my project website for ECE 4160: Fast Robots @ Cornell University. A little about myself: 
I am currently a junior at Cornell studying Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering. As of now, 
I'm really interested in robotics and computer architecture. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions - ens57@cornell.edu
