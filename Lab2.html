            <p class="mb-5">The purpose of this lab was to set up communicaton between the computer and the Artemis nano using the bluetooh stack.
                For the Artemis side of the communication, the Arduino IDE was used and for the computer side, Python was used through Jupyter Lab. 
                The main task in this lab was to understand how to send, receive, and interpret commands and data.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">BLE Overview</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) library is a more energy efficient and optimized version of Bluetooth and is used in situations 
                        that don't need to exchange/send large amounts of data. It exists within arduino and already contains the necessary hardware 
                        support. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Artemis Side </h3>
                    <p> 
                        The ArduinoBLE library was installed within the IDE and its main file, ble_arduino.ino example was the base of this lab. 
                        When running the sketch, the Artemis' MAC address was printed to the serial monitor. 

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Computer Side</h3>
                        <p> 

                            Python was the main language that was used along with its packages such as numpy, pyyaml, colorama,
                            nest_asyncio, and bleak. A virtual environment was also used to ensure that there were no dependency 
                            errors and each student's machine had the appropiate packages and libraries. In this case, 
                            the FastRobots_ble environment was used. These were installed using these 
                            commands: 
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/eshitasangani/b4b75dd92bd24703474d891b3ace8ce4.js"></script>
                        </p>
                    
                    <h4 class="mb-0">Communication between Artemis and Computer</h3>
                        <p> 
                            Checking that the MAC address printed on the Artemis and computer side was the same is how 
                            the bluetooh connectivity was verified. Within the codebase, a demo.ipynb file setup the bluetooth 
                            connection. To define the addresses, UUIDS (Universally Unique Identifiers) was used which helps 
                            differentiate between the types of data being sent. A new UUID was created and inserted in the appropiate 
                            connections file. The MAC address of the artemis was added to the connections file as well. The result of 
                            this communiction is below:

                            <img src="assets/artemis.jpg" alt="..." width="100%" />
                            Here are a few examples of sending + receiving commands. 
                            This is how the commands are sent on the computer side:

                            This is how they were received on the artemis side: 
                            <img src="assets/commands.jpg" alt="..." width="90%" />
